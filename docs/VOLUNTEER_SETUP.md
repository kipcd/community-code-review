# Volunteer Setup Guide

Thank you for allowing the use of your hardware by our community code review network!

You'll run a **Docker container** on your machine that uses your GPU to help review pull requests. The container:

- ✅ Has access to **only** your GPU and a folder you choose
- ✅ Makes **only outbound** connections to the code review coordinator
- ✅ **Downloads and runs the needed model, and joins our hardware pool automatically**
- ✅ **Works behind NAT, home routers, and firewalls** — no port forwarding needed
- ❌ **Cannot** access your files, network, or system
- ❌ **Never** accepts inbound connections from the internet

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | How to Check | Details |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Windows OS (default) | You know what OS you're running, right? | (Mac/Linux users: Follow the instructions for Terminal below) |
| Docker Desktop | Look for the Docker whale icon in your system tray (taskbar) | Install from [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) — enable **WSL 2 backend** during setup on Windows |
| NVIDIA GPU (optional, but recommended!) | Open **Task Manager → Performance** tab — look for "GPU" | Install latest NVIDIA drivers from [nvidia.com/drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers) |
| 12GB+ free disk | Check **This PC** in File Explorer | For the model file (~7GB) + Docker image |
| 8GB+ VRAM (GPU) or 16GB+ RAM (CPU) | Task Manager → Performance → GPU "Dedicated GPU memory" | Required for smooth performance |

> **No GPU?** You can still help! The container will run on CPU. It's slower, but every bit helps.

## Option 1: Run via Docker Desktop (easiest)

No command line needed — everything is done with mouse clicks.

### Step 1: Create a folder for the model

Create a folder called `code-review-models` somewhere on your computer — for example, in File Explorer go to `C:\` and make a new folder. Note the drive will need 12GB free.

### Step 2: Run the container

1. Open **Docker Desktop** (double-click the whale icon in your system tray)
2. Go to the **Images** tab
3. In the search bar at the top, type `ghcr.io/slopsmith/volunteer` and press Enter
4. When the image appears, click the **Run** button (the play icon) next to it — Docker Desktop will pull the image automatically
5. A dialog titled **"Run a new container"** will open. Click **Optional Settings** to expand it
6. Fill in the dialog. (Note the name is just a way for us to distinguish you from other volunteers; your GitHub or Discord username is a good option.)

   | Field | Value |
   |-------|-------|
   | **Container name** | `code-review-volunteer` |
   | **Ports** | leave empty |
   | **Volumes** | click **Add Volume** → set Host Path to `C:\code-review-models` (or what you choseand Container Path to `/models` |
   | **Env Variables** | add each one below |

   | Variable | Value |
   |----------|-------|
   | `COORDINATOR_URL` | `<coordinator-url>` |
   | `VOLUNTEER_ID` | `<your-name>` |
   | `VOLUNTEER_SECRET` | `<coordinator-secret>` |

7. Click **Run**

The container will start and appear in the **Containers** tab with a green "Running" indicator.

> **No GPU?** Leave the GPU settings as-is. The container detects your GPU automatically. If you don't have one, add `GPU_DEVICES` with value `none` in the environment variables section.

## Option 2: Run via Docker Desktop's built-in terminal

If you prefer a command line, use the terminal built into Docker Desktop — it's already configured correctly and uses bash syntax.

### Step 1: Open Docker's terminal

1. Open **Docker Desktop** (double-click the whale icon in your system tray)
2. At the bottom-right of the Docker Desktop window, click the **terminal icon** (or go to the **Containers** tab and click the terminal button)
3. A bash shell will open

### Step 2: Create a folder for the model

```bash
# Run this in Docker's built-in terminal
mkdir -p /c/Users/YourName/code-review-models
```

You can also just create the folder in File Explorer — the path will be `/c/Users/YourName/code-review-models` in the Docker terminal.

### Step 3: Run the container

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name code-review-volunteer \
  --gpus all \
  -v /c/Users/YourName/code-review-models:/models \
  -e COORDINATOR_URL="<coordinator-url>" \
  -e VOLUNTEER_ID="<your-github-or-discord-name>" \
  -e VOLUNTEER_SECRET="<coordinator-secret>" \
  ghcr.io/<your-org>/volunteer:latest
```

Fill in the values from your coordinator:

- `<coordinator-url>` — the coordinator's web address (look for `https://` from the leader)
- `<coordinator-secret>` — the secret password the leader gave you
- `YourName` — your Windows username (or use the folder path you created)

> **No GPU?** Remove the `--gpus all` line and add `-e GPU_DEVICES=none` instead.

## What You'll See

After running the container, go to **Docker Desktop → Containers** tab and click on `code-review-volunteer`. The logs will show something like:

```text
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗

```

When a review comes in, you'll see a log message like:

```

✅ Review complete — result sent back to coordinator
```

## Understanding the Options

### `--gpus all`

Gives the container access to your GPU. Without this flag, the container won't see your GPU at all. If you have multiple GPUs, the container auto-selects the first one by default. You can change this behavior with `GPU_DEVICES`; See below.

### `-v C:\code-review-models:/models`

This shares a folder on your Windows machine so the model file persists between runs. Create the folder in File Explorer first, then use the path `C:\code-review-models` or wherever you put it.

### `COORDINATOR_URL`

The web address of the coordinator (looks like `https://something.ts.net`). Provided by whoever is running this.

### `VOLUNTEER_ID`

A friendly name so the team knows who's helping. Defaults to your computer's hostname. Better to set it to the name by which you're known in the community (eg GitHub name, Discord handle).

### `VOLUNTEER_SECRET`

The coordinator requires authentication, so you must set this — the coordinator will reject your connection without the correct value.

## Advanced: CPU-only Mode

If you don't have a GPU (or don't want to share it), open Docker Desktop's terminal and run:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name code-review-volunteer \
  -v /c/Users/YourName/code-review-models:/models \
  -e COORDINATOR_URL="<coordinator-url>" \
  -e VOLUNTEER_ID="my-cpu-rig" \
  -e GPU_DEVICES="none" \
  ghcr.io/<your-org>/volunteer:latest
```

> Remove the `--gpus all` flag when running CPU-only — it will cause an error if no GPU is available. This command already has `GPU_DEVICES=none` set.

## Advanced: Custom Model

If the coordinator asks you to use a different model, open Docker Desktop's terminal and run:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name code-review-volunteer \
  --gpus all \
  -v /c/Users/YourName/code-review-models:/models \
  -e COORDINATOR_URL="<coordinator-url>" \
  -e MODEL_REPO="Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-GGUF" \
  -e MODEL_FILE="Qwen3-30B-A3B-Q4_K_M.gguf" \
  ghcr.io/<your-org>/volunteer:latest
```

Or from a direct download URL:

```bash
  -e MODEL_URL="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-GGUF/resolve/main/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Q4_K_M.gguf?download=true"
```

### `GPU_DEVICES` (optional)

Controls which GPU to use when you have multiple GPUs. By default the container auto-selects the first available GPU.

- `-e GPU_DEVICES="all"` — use all GPUs
- `-e GPU_DEVICES="0,1"` — use specific GPUs by index
- `-e GPU_DEVICES="none"` — CPU only (omit `--gpus all` flag too)

Most volunteers won't need to set this.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| "no NVIDIA GPU detected" | Docker Desktop not using WSL 2, or no NVIDIA driver | Check Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → WSL Integration is enabled; update GPU drivers from nvidia.com |
| "Coordinator not reachable" | Wrong URL or coordinator is down | Check the coordinator URL is correct and the server is running |
| "Registration rejected" | Wrong VOLUNTEER_SECRET | Ask the coordinator for the correct secret |
| "Model download failed" | Network issue or wrong URL | Check MODEL_URL is correct |
| Container exits immediately | Docker Desktop GPU passthrough not configured | Run without `--gpus all` and add `-e GPU_DEVICES=none` for CPU fallback |
| Slow reviews | Under-powered machine | Every bit helps! Consider lowering `LLAMA_CTX_SIZE=16384` |

## Stopping

In **Docker Desktop**, go to the **Containers** tab, find `code-review-volunteer`, click the **stop** icon. To remove it, click the **delete** icon next to it.

Or in Docker Desktop's terminal:

```bash
docker stop code-review-volunteer
docker rm code-review-volunteer
```

You can stop anytime. The coordinator will detect your absence and route reviews to other volunteers. No hard feelings! 🎉

## Checking Logs

In **Docker Desktop**, go to the **Containers** tab, click on `code-review-volunteer`, then click the **Logs** tab.

Or in Docker Desktop's terminal:

```bash
docker logs -f code-review-volunteer
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop following logs (container keeps running).

## FAQ

**Q: Will this slow down my computer?**
A: The container uses your GPU, but only when a PR review is happening. Between reviews, it idles. You can set `LLAMA_N_PARALLEL=1` to limit GPU usage.

**Q: Does the coordinator have any access to my machine?**
A: No. The coordinator only knows about your `VOLUNTEER_ID` and GPU info. All communication is your container reaching out to check in.

**Q: How much bandwidth does this use?**
A: The initial model download is ~7GB. After that, only small JSON payloads for reviews — typically a few KB per review.

**Q: How do I check if my GPU is working with Docker?**
A. In Docker Desktop's terminal (or any terminal), run:

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.0-base nvidia-smi
```

If you see GPU info, it's working. If you get an error, make sure Docker Desktop is using the WSL 2 backend and your NVIDIA drivers are up to date.
